	abstract={Paper and presentation delivered at the Workshop on Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) at the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2019) in Champaign, Illinois. Web archives are becoming increasingly important to our digital infrastructure, as is judging the quality of these archives. With the growing popularity of complex visual styling enabled by Javascript, AJAX, and cascading style sheets (CSS), visual representation of information on the web has become an important part of judging the quality of archived web pages. In the context of web archives, we define visual correspondence as “the similarity in appearance between the original website and the archived website”, as initially defined by Reyes Ayala. This paper examines how the visual correspondence of an archived website can be measured using popular image similarity measures. Using these measures we evaluate how visual correspondence can be used as an indication of overall archive quality. We are interested in answering the following research question: How effective are different similarity measures at measuring the visual correspondence between an archived website and its live counterpart?},

	title={A Grounded Theory of Information Quality in Web Archives},
	journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
	abstract={Web archiving is the practice of preserving websites as a historical record. It is a technologically-challenging endeavor that has as its goal the creation of a high-quality archived website that looks and behaves exactly like the original website. Despite the importance of the notion of quality, comprehensive definitions of Information Quality (IQ) in a web archive have yet to be developed. Currently, the field has no single, comprehensive theory that describes what is a high-quality or low-quality archived website. Furthermore, most of the research that has been conducted on web archives has been system-centered and not user-centered, leading to a dearth of information on how humans perceive web archives. This dissertation seeks to remedy this problem by presenting a user-centered grounded theory of IQ for web archives. It answers two research questions: 1) What is the definition of information quality (IQ) for web archives? and 2) How can IQ in a web archive be measured? The theory presented is grounded on data obtained from users of the Internet Archive's Archive-It system, the largest web-archiving subscription service in the United States. Also presented are mathematical definitions for each dimension of IQ, which can then be applied to measure the quality of a web archive.},

	abstract={Creating an archived website that is as close as possible to the original, live website remains one of the most difficult challenges in the field of web archiving. Failing to adequately capture a website might mean an incomplete historical record or, worse, no evidence that the site ever even existed. This paper presents a grounded theory of quality for web archives created using data from web archivists. In order to achieve this, I analysed support tickets submitted by clients of the Internet Archive's Archive-It (AIT), a subscription-based web archiving service that helps organisations build and manage their own web archives. Overall, 305 tickets were analysed, comprising 2544 interactions. The resulting theory is comprised of three dimensions of quality in a web archive: correspondence, relevance, and archivability. The dimension of correspondence, defined as the degree of similarity or resemblance between the original website and the archived website, is the most important facet of quality in web archives, and it is the main focus of this work. This paper's contribution is that it presents the first theory created specifically for web archives and lays the groundwork for future theoretical developments in the field. Furthermore, the theory is human-centred and grounded in how users and creators of web archives perceive their quality. By clarifying the notion of quality in a web archive, this research will be of benefit to web archivists and cultural heritage institutions.},
